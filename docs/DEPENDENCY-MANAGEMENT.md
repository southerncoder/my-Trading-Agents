# Dependency Management Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the dependency management strategy, tools, and procedures for the TradingAgents system. It covers automated monitoring, safe update procedures, and security practices.

## Dependency Management Strategy

### Update Schedule

- **Security Updates**: Immediate (within 24 hours of discovery)
- **Minor Updates**: Monthly (first Tuesday of each month)
- **Major Updates**: Quarterly (with thorough testing)
- **LTS Updates**: As needed (Node.js, major frameworks)

### Risk Assessment

#### Low Risk Updates
- Patch versions (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
- Security patches
- Documentation updates

#### Medium Risk Updates
- Minor versions (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- New features without breaking changes
- Dependency updates

#### High Risk Updates
- Major versions (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
- Breaking changes
- Framework updates
- Runtime updates (Node.js major versions)

## Automated Tools

### 1. Dependency Update Script

Safe dependency updates with automatic rollback:

```powershell
# Check current status
npm run deps:check

# Update minor versions (safe)
npm run deps:update

# Update security patches only
npm run deps:update:security

# Update major versions (requires testing)
npm run deps:update:major

# Dry run to see what would be updated
.\scripts\dependency-update.ps1 -DryRun
```

### 2. Dependency Monitor

Continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities:

```powershell
# One-time check
npm run deps:monitor

# Continuous monitoring (runs every hour)
.\scripts\dependency-monitor.ps1 -Continuous -IntervalMinutes 60
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

Automated daily security scans with issue creation for critical vulnerabilities.

## Manual Procedures

### Pre-Update Checklist

- [ ] Review current system stability
- [ ] Check for any ongoing issues
- [ ] Ensure backup systems are functional
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window if needed
- [ ] Review dependency changelogs

### Update Process

1. **Backup Current State**
   ```powershell
   # Automatic backup is created by update script
   .\scripts\dependency-update.ps1
   ```

2. **Test Updates**
   - Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Run unit tests: `npm run test`
   - Run integration tests: `npm run test:all`

3. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Test full workflow
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Performance testing

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy during maintenance window
   - Monitor system health
   - Have rollback plan ready

### Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected after an update:

```powershell
# List available backups
Get-ChildItem backups/dependency-updates/

# Rollback to specific backup
.\scripts\dependency-rollback.ps1 -BackupPath "backups/dependency-updates/trading-agents-20241210-143022"
```

## Security Practices

### Vulnerability Management

1. **Daily Monitoring**
   - Automated GitHub Actions scan
   - Email alerts for critical issues
   - Issue tracking for remediation

2. **Response Times**
   - Critical: 24 hours
   - High: 72 hours
   - Medium: 1 week
   - Low: Next scheduled update

3. **Assessment Process**
   - Impact analysis
   - Exploitability assessment
   - Business risk evaluation
   - Remediation planning

### Security Tools

- **npm audit**: Built-in vulnerability scanner
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates (if enabled)
- **Snyk**: Advanced vulnerability scanning (optional)

## Dependency Categories

### Core Dependencies

Critical to system operation:
- Node.js runtime
- TypeScript compiler
- LangChain/LangGraph
- Database drivers (pg, redis)
- Express framework

**Update Policy**: Conservative, thorough testing required

### Development Dependencies

Build and development tools:
- ESLint, Prettier
- Testing frameworks
- Build tools (Vite)
- Type definitions

**Update Policy**: Regular updates, less critical

### Transitive Dependencies

Dependencies of dependencies:
- Automatically updated with parent packages
- Monitor for security issues
- Override if necessary

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics Tracked

- Number of outdated packages
- Security vulnerability count by severity
- Update success/failure rates
- Time since last security update

### Alert Conditions

- Critical vulnerabilities detected
- High vulnerabilities > 7 days old
- Update failures
- Dependency conflicts

### Reporting

- Daily security summary
- Weekly dependency status report
- Monthly update recommendations
- Quarterly dependency review

## Best Practices

### Package Selection

1. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Active maintenance
   - Security track record
   - Community support
   - License compatibility
   - Bundle size impact

2. **Avoid**
   - Unmaintained packages
   - Packages with known security issues
   - Overly complex dependencies
   - Packages with incompatible licenses

### Version Management

1. **Semantic Versioning**
   - Use caret (^) for minor updates
   - Use tilde (~) for patch updates
   - Pin exact versions for critical dependencies

2. **Lock Files**
   - Always commit package-lock.json
   - Regularly update lock files
   - Verify integrity after updates

### Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for all critical paths
   - Integration tests for external dependencies
   - Security tests for vulnerability detection

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Full workflow testing
   - Performance impact assessment
   - User acceptance testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependency Conflicts**
   ```bash
   npm ls --depth=0
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Version Mismatches**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix --force  # Use with caution
   ```

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Critical Security Issue**
   - Immediate assessment
   - Emergency update if possible
   - System isolation if necessary
   - Incident response activation

2. **Update Failure**
   - Automatic rollback
   - Root cause analysis
   - Alternative update strategy
   - Manual intervention if needed
