# Current Development Todos

**Last Updated:** August 25, 2025  
**Sprint:** Container Architecture & Memory Integration - PARTIALLY COMPLETED  

## 🚨 In Progress - Memory Integration Issue

### Zep Graphiti Memory Integration Debugging
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Library Compatibility Issue  
**Started Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Issue:** Graphiti library episode addition failing with "Failed to add episode: event" error

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Containerized services fully operational (Docker + PowerShell automation)
- ✅ Service health checks passing
- ✅ API connectivity working
- ❌ Episode addition failing in underlying Graphiti library

**Technical Details:**
- Error occurs in `graphiti_client.add_episode()` call
- Error message: "Failed to add episode: event" 
- Mapped episode types correctly: text, json, message, event
- Issue appears to be Graphiti library version compatibility

**Investigation Required:**
1. **Graphiti Library Version Check**: Verify graphiti_core version compatibility
2. **Episode Type Validation**: Test with minimal episode data
3. **Library Documentation Review**: Check Graphiti API changes
4. **Alternative Episode Formats**: Try different episode type combinations
5. **Library Downgrade**: Consider using stable Graphiti version

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `py_zep/src/zep_service/main.py` - Added debug logging and synchronous episode addition
- ✅ `js/src/providers/zep-graphiti-memory-provider.ts` - Fixed episode type handling
- ✅ `js/tests/test-zep-graphiti-memory.ts` - Updated to use supported episode types

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with different Graphiti library versions
2. Validate episode data format against latest Graphiti docs
3. Consider fallback memory implementation if library issues persist
4. Complete end-to-end workflow testing once memory is operational
