# Performance Tuning

## Expected Performance

- Standard Analysis: 30-60 seconds
- Deep Analysis: 60-120 seconds  
- Backtesting (1 year): 2-5 minutes
- Risk Assessment: 5-15 seconds

## Key Optimizations
- Memory Usage: 1-2 GB under normal load
- CPU Usage: 20-40% during analysis
- Database Connections: 5-15 active connections
- Network I/O: 10-50 MB per analysis

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
docker-compose exec trading-agents npm run performance:benchmark

# Test specific components
docker-compose exec trading-agents npm run performance:test-analysis
docker-compose exec trading-agents npm run performance:test-backtesting
docker-compose exec trading-agents npm run performance:test-database
```

## Database Optimization

```sql
-- Memory settings (adjust for available RAM)
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '512MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '2GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '16MB';

-- Query optimization
ALTER SYSTEM SET random_page_cost = 1.1;
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_io_concurrency = 200;

SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

## Caching

- Multi-tier L1/L2 caching system
- Redis for distributed caching
- LRU eviction for memory management

```bash
# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
npm run test:load
```

## Monitoring

- Real-time performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking  
- Database query monitoring
- Automated alerting for thresholds
