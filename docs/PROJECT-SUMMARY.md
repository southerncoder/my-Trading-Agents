```typescript
// Dynamic API resolution
const checkAPI = async () => {
  const langGraph = await import('@langchain/langgraph');
  const coreMessages = await import('@langchain/core/messages');
  
  // Validate available exports and adapt accordingly
  if ('MessagesAnnotation' in langGraph) {
    // Use direct annotation if available
  } else if ('messagesStateReducer' in langGraph) {
    // Use reducer pattern as fallback
  }
};
```

### Enhanced Model Provider System
```typescript
export class ModelProvider {
  static createFromConfig(config: TradingAgentsConfig) {
    switch (config.llmProvider) {
      case 'lm_studio':
        return this.createLMStudioModels(config);
      case 'openai':
        return this.createOpenAIModels(config);
      // ... additional providers
    }
  }
}
```

### Dual Execution Architecture
```typescript
export class EnhancedTradingAgentsGraph {
  async analyzeAndDecide(company: string, date: string) {
    const execution = await this.execute(company, date);
    
    return {
      decision: this.extractDecision(execution.result),
      reasoning: this.extractReasoning(execution.result),
