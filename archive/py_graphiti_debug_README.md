# Archived: Debug Embedder Scripts

This directory contains the original `py_graphiti_debug` folder used for initial manual testing and debugging of the ZepGraphiti embedder integration.

It is now archived and no longer part of the active codebase. The main project code has integrated these changes and no longer requires this standalone debug folder.

Contents:
- `.env.local` (copy of environment variables used)
- `debug_embedder.py` (script to test embedder in isolation)
- `graph_service` (debug version of service files)

Original Location: `py_graphiti_debug/`

No further updates will be made here.
