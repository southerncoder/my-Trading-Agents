Branch: advanced-memory-system-2025-08-30

Summary:
- Add per-agent embedding support and memory-aware model selection

Details:
- Added `allowEmbeddingModel` and `embeddingModel` fields to agent types and defaults.
- Updated `js/src/config/enhanced-loader.ts` to respect `CONSIDER_MEMORY` and skip assigning embedding models as primary LLMs for analyst agents unless `allowEmbeddingModel` is true.
- Updated `js/src/memory/agent-model-mapping.json` to include embedding recommendations for analyst roles.
- Added sample per-agent config `js/src/agents/configs/market_analyst.json` demonstrating `model` and `embeddingModel` usage.
- Added unit tests `tests/config/enhanced-loader-embedding.test.ts` validating memory-aware behavior and opt-in.
