## Progress as of 2025-09-08

### ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS (2025-09-08)

#### Documentation Consolidation (Merged to Main)
- ✅ **Centralized Secret Management**: Implemented comprehensive documentation consolidation
  - ✅ Consolidated all .env.local references across documentation files
  - ✅ Removed scattered configuration references and established cross-references
  - ✅ Streamlined zep-graphiti/ARCHITECTURE.md to reduce verbosity
  - ✅ Updated README.md with consolidated quick start and architecture overview
  - ✅ Streamlined docs/GETTING-STARTED.md with references to main config docs
  - ✅ Consolidated docs/CONFIGURATION.md with secrets management and provider setup
  - ✅ Updated DOCKER-README.md to reflect centralized configuration
  - ✅ Consolidated docs/IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md from detailed specs to high-level summary
  - ✅ Successfully merged documentation changes to main branch

#### Zep Services Infrastructure Hardening
- ✅ **Entity-Node Testing**: Re-run ingestion `/entity-node` test while streaming logs - **NO 500 ERRORS FOUND**, service running cleanly
- ✅ **JSON Parsing Hardening**: Enhanced `py_zep/secrets/start-wrapper.sh` with comprehensive error handling, response size limits, and robust validation
- ✅ **Docker Secrets Migration**: Moved all sensitive API keys (MarketStack, Reddit credentials) to Docker secrets, cleaned `.env.local`
- ✅ **Diagnostic Logging**: Confirmed wrapper writes 8 diagnostic files to `/tmp` and structured logs to `/var/log/lm_wrapper.log`
- ✅ **Enhanced Retry System**: Implemented comprehensive retry/backoff logic in `py_zep/utils/enhanced_retry.py` with exponential backoff, jitter, and circuit breaker patterns
- ✅ **Retry Integration**: Added configurable retry policies in `py_zep/utils/retry_integration.py` for different operation types (embedder calls, API requests, database operations)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging and recovery mechanisms for transient network failures and service interruptions

#### Risk Management System
- ✅ **RiskManager Class**: Created complete RiskManager implementation in `js/src/agents/risk-mgmt/risk-manager.ts` that integrates all risk analysts
- ✅ **Risk Analyst Integration**: Successfully integrated portfolio-manager, risky-analyst, safe-analyst, and neutral-analyst with proper coordination
- ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Implemented comprehensive risk evaluation logic with position sizing, stop-loss management, and portfolio diversification

#### Technical Indicators Engine
- ✅ **Real Calculations**: Implemented actual technical indicator calculations in `js/src/dataflows/technical-indicators.ts` (no placeholders)
- ✅ **Complete Indicator Suite**: RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Ichimoku Cloud, Stochastic RSI, Fibonacci retracements
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All indicators use real mathematical formulas with proper data validation and error handling

#### Data Integration APIs
- ✅ **Yahoo Finance API**: Real API integration in `js/src/dataflows/yahoo-finance.ts` using dedicated Yahoo Finance service (no mocks)
- ✅ **Google News API**: Real API integration in `js/src/dataflows/google-news.ts` using dedicated Google News service
- ✅ **Reddit API**: Real API integration in `js/src/dataflows/reddit.ts` using dedicated Reddit service client for social sentiment
- ✅ **OpenAI Web Search**: Real LLM-powered web search integration in `js/src/dataflows/openai-data.ts` with structured prompts

### Previous Progress (2025-08-30)
- Implemented and installed a cleaned `start-wrapper.sh` in `py_zep/secrets` that normalizes LM Studio URLs, prefers `/v1/models`, supports an `EMBEDDER_LM_STUDIO_URL` override, and has Python fallback HTTP helpers when `curl` is missing.
- Updated `py_zep/docker-compose.yml` to fix Neo4j URI resolution and removed the environment override for `OPENAI_API_KEY` so `.env.local` values are used.
- Persisted embedder settings in `py_zep/.env.local` (including `EMBEDDER_LM_STUDIO_URL` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`) and set a development placeholder `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-local` to allow local LM Studio requests.
- Verified that `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1/models` contains `text-embedding-qwen3-embedding-4b` and that direct POSTs to `/v1/embeddings` succeed from inside the container.
- Reproduced the Graphiti embedder flow; sync and async embedder calls (via installed `openai` and `graphiti_core` wrappers) returned embeddings when environment variables were set correctly.
- Observed an intermittent 500 on `/entity-node`; logs previously showed connection errors (empty Bearer header) which we fixed by adjusting environment and compose. Remaining 500s require an ingestion re-run to capture any further tracebacks.

### Next Actions
- Consider implementing SimFin data integration for enhanced fundamental analysis
- Evaluate memory system enhancements for improved context retrieval and learning
- Focus on medium priority memory system improvements (similarity algorithms, ML optimization)
