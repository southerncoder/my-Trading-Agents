- âœ… **Examples Integration**: Learning system examples added to README

### Zep Services Infrastructure
- âœ… Re-run ingestion `/entity-node` test while streaming logs to capture any 500 errors and full tracebacks - **NO 500 ERRORS FOUND**
- âœ… Harden `py_zep/secrets/start-wrapper.sh` JSON parsing for `/v1/models` listing with comprehensive error handling and validation
- âœ… Move real `embedder_api_key` into Docker secrets and remove secrets from `.env.local` - migrated MarketStack, Reddit, and all API keys
- âœ… Confirm wrapper writes diagnostics to `/tmp` and `/var/log` as expected in container runs - verified 8 diagnostic files and structured logging

### Zep Services Retry Logic
- âœ… Added retry/backoff logic and improved error logging around embedder calls in `py_zep/utils/enhanced_retry.py`
- âœ… Implemented configurable retry policies in `py_zep/utils/retry_integration.py`

### Core Placeholders
- âœ… Created actual RiskManager class that integrates existing risk analysts (portfolio-manager, risky-analyst, safe-analyst, neutral-analyst) in `js/src/agents/risk-mgmt/risk-manager.ts`
- âœ… Implemented real technical indicators calculations (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Ichimoku, Stochastic RSI, Fibonacci) in `js/src/dataflows/technical-indicators.ts`
- âœ… Replaced OpenAI data placeholders with actual web search integration using LLM prompts in `js/src/dataflows/openai-data.ts`

### Data Integration APIs
- âœ… Implemented Yahoo Finance API integration to replace placeholder in `js/src/dataflows/yahoo-finance.ts`
- âœ… Added Google News API integration in `js/src/dataflows/google-news.ts`
- âœ… Implemented Reddit API integration for social sentiment in `js/src/dataflows/reddit.ts`
- [ ] Add SimFin data file reading for fundamental analysis in `simfin.ts` (still pending)

Completed (high level):
- start-wrapper cleaned and installed
- docker-compose Neo4j URI fixed
- persisting embedder settings in `.env.local`
