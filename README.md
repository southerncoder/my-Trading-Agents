**Production-Ready TypeScript Multi-Agent LLM Trading Framework** with enterprise-grade memory system, client-based architecture, and comprehensive infrastructure enhancements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: **Production Ready** âœ…
- âœ… **Entity_Node Functionality**: Fully operational with complete CRUD operations
- âœ… **Client-Based Architecture**: All Graphiti integrations use proper client libraries
- âœ… **Infrastructure Enhanced**: Docker networking, retry mechanisms, security hardening
- âœ… **TypeScript-Python Bridge**: Seamless cross-language integration
- âœ… **100% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with enterprise-grade validation

See [`docs/PRODUCT-OVERVIEW.md`](docs/PRODUCT-OVERVIEW.md) for a concise summary, features, and quick start.

## Memory System
**Zep Graphiti Integration** - Production-ready memory system with:
- âœ… **Official Client Library**: All interactions use proper Graphiti client (no HTTP calls)
- âœ… **TypeScript-Python Bridge**: Seamless cross-language integration
- âœ… **Entity Operations**: Complete CRUD functionality for knowledge graph management
- âœ… **Enhanced Infrastructure**: Docker networking, retry mechanisms, security hardening
- âœ… **Episode Storage**: Persistent memory across trading sessions

## Examples & Demos
- See `js/examples/` for memory and provider demos
- See `py_zep/tests/` for client-based Graphiti integration examples
- TypeScript Bridge: `js/src/providers/graphiti-client-bridge.ts`
- Client-Based Provider: `js/src/providers/zep-graphiti-memory-provider-client.ts`

## Quick Start
```bash
# Start enhanced Zep Graphiti services
cd py_zep
.\start-services-secure.ps1

# Run TypeScript trading agents
cd js
npm install
npm run cli  # Interactive trading interface
```

## Observability

The JavaScript service includes an OpenTelemetry-based observability integration that supports Traces, Metrics, and Logs. Key features:

- OTLP exporter support (traces, metrics, logs) configurable by environment variables.
- A safe, optional logger â†’ OpenTelemetry logs bridge that forwards structured Winston logs to an OTLP collector when `ENABLE_OTEL` is set.
- Integration tests and a mock OTLP collector used in CI to validate emissions.

How to enable locally:

```bash
# Enable OpenTelemetry features
export ENABLE_OTEL=1
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318/v1
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=trading-agents-js
```

Run the Node app or tests as usual; the OTEL initializer lazily loads heavy packages and will not break tests or dev workflows when disabled.

CI: The repository contains a CI job that runs a lightweight mock-collector integration test to assert logs are emitted to an OTLP endpoint when enabled.

## Secrets Handling

Short guidance for contributors:

- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or private keys to the repository. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Add any runtime `.env` files to `.gitignore` (already configured in this repo).
- If a secret is accidentally committed, immediately rotate the credential and follow the history-rewrite steps in `tools/remove-secrets.md`.
- Use the provided pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) and the CI `gitleaks` job to detect secrets before merging.
- For development, use `.env.example` files with placeholder values and document how to obtain test credentials.
