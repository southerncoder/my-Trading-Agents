## Observability

The JavaScript service includes an OpenTelemetry-based observability integration that supports Traces, Metrics, and Logs. Key features:

- OTLP exporter support (traces, metrics, logs) configurable by environment variables.
- A safe, optional logger â†’ OpenTelemetry logs bridge that forwards structured Winston logs to an OTLP collector when `ENABLE_OTEL` is set.
- Integration tests and a mock OTLP collector used in CI to validate emissions.

How to enable locally:

```bash
# Enable OpenTelemetry features
export ENABLE_OTEL=1
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318/v1
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=trading-agents-js
```

Run the Node app or tests as usual; the OTEL initializer lazily loads heavy packages and will not break tests or dev workflows when disabled.

CI: The repository contains a CI job that runs a lightweight mock-collector integration test to assert logs are emitted to an OTLP endpoint when enabled.

## Secrets Handling

Short guidance for contributors:

- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or private keys to the repository. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Add any runtime `.env` files to `.gitignore` (already configured in this repo).
- If a secret is accidentally committed, immediately rotate the credential and follow the history-rewrite steps in `tools/remove-secrets.md`.
- Use the provided pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) and the CI `gitleaks` job to detect secrets before merging.
- For development, use `.env.example` files with placeholder values and document how to obtain test credentials.
