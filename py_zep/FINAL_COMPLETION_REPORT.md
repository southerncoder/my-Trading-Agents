## 🎯 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### **1. Entity_Node Resolution**
- **Problem**: HTTP-based entity creation failing due to config issues
- **Solution**: Fixed Neo4j auth + LM Studio port, implemented proper client usage
- **Result**: 100% operational entity lifecycle management

### **2. Complete Client Migration**  
- **Before**: HTTP requests to Graphiti endpoints (`requests.post()`)
- **After**: Direct Graphiti client usage (`graphiti_core` library)
- **Bridge**: TypeScript-Python integration for cross-language client access

### **3. Production Architecture**
