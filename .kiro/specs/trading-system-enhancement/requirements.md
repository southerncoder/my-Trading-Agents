# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TradingAgents framework is a production-ready TypeScript multi-agent trading system with sophisticated infrastructure including 12 specialized agents, enterprise memory (Zep Graphiti), and multi-provider data integration. However, several critical components identified in the implementation gap analysis need completion before safe live deployment.

This comprehensive enhancement addresses four priority areas: backtesting framework (critical for strategy validation), risk management completion (replacing placeholder functions), strategy enhancements (ensemble methods and position sizing), and data provider resilience (fallback systems). These enhancements will transform the current framework from a sophisticated analysis tool into a complete, production-ready trading system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backtesting Framework

**User Story:** As a trading strategy developer, I want to backtest my strategies against historical data, so that I can validate their performance before risking real capital.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a strategy and date range THEN the system SHALL execute the strategy against historical market data
2. WHEN backtesting is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance metrics including returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown
3. WHEN executing simulated trades THEN the system SHALL apply realistic bid-ask spreads, slippage, and trading commissions
4. WHEN performing walk-forward analysis THEN the system SHALL split data into in-sample and out-of-sample periods to detect overfitting
5. WHEN backtesting completes THEN the system SHALL generate equity curve visualizations and performance reports

### Requirement 2: Risk Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want complete risk assessment functions, so that position sizing and risk calculations are accurate rather than using placeholder values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing technical indicator risk THEN the system SHALL analyze RSI extreme zones, MACD divergence, and Bollinger Band patterns instead of returning placeholder values
2. WHEN calculating quantitative risk models THEN the system SHALL compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR using Monte Carlo simulation
3. WHEN evaluating sector sentiment THEN the system SHALL integrate real news sentiment analysis by sector instead of returning zero
4. WHEN analyzing volatility THEN the system SHALL implement GARCH models and historical volatility calculations instead of hardcoded values
5. WHEN detecting volatility clustering THEN the system SHALL perform ARCH tests for heteroscedasticity

### Requirement 3: Strategy Enhancement System

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want advanced strategy capabilities including ensemble methods and dynamic position sizing, so that I can implement sophisticated trading approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple strategies generate signals THEN the system SHALL aggregate signals using ensemble voting with confidence weighting
2. WHEN conflicting signals occur THEN the system SHALL resolve contradictions using correlation analysis and recent performance weighting
3. WHEN sizing positions THEN the system SHALL implement Kelly Criterion and risk parity allocation methods
4. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust strategy parameters based on regime detection
5. WHEN strategies underperform THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance ensemble weights based on rolling performance windows

### Requirement 4: Data Provider Resilience

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust data provider fallback systems, so that the system continues operating when primary data sources fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary news provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to secondary providers (Google News, NewsAPI, Brave News)
2. WHEN social media data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached sentiment data and alternative sources (Reddit + Twitter)
3. WHEN fundamentals data provider fails THEN the system SHALL cascade through Yahoo Finance → Alpha Vantage → MarketStack
4. WHEN all providers fail THEN the system SHALL use cached data with staleness warnings and graceful degradation
5. WHEN provider health degrades THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures

### Requirement 5: Performance Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want comprehensive performance tracking and alerting, so that I can monitor system health and trading performance in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategies execute THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics with rolling windows (30d, 90d, 1y)
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts based on configurable thresholds
3. WHEN comparing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance testing and correlation analysis
4. WHEN system resources are stressed THEN the system SHALL monitor and alert on API rate limits, memory usage, and response times
5. WHEN anomalies occur THEN the system SHALL detect unusual patterns in performance or system behavior

### Requirement 6: Integration and Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want seamless integration with existing infrastructure, so that enhancements leverage the current 12-agent system, memory architecture, and data providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Zep Graphiti memory system for graph-based persistence
2. WHEN storing structured data THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL for relational data, performance metrics, and time-series storage
3. WHEN agents need episodic memory THEN the system SHALL store conversation history and interaction logs in PostgreSQL with JSONB flexibility
4. WHEN agents need semantic memory THEN the system SHALL maintain long-term facts and knowledge in PostgreSQL with pgvector for embedding-based retrieval
5. WHEN agents need working memory THEN the system SHALL track active context in PostgreSQL with TTL-based expiration
6. WHEN agents need procedural memory THEN the system SHALL store learned patterns and preferences in PostgreSQL with efficient indexing
7. WHEN processing market data THEN the system SHALL use current Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and MarketStack providers
8. WHEN executing analysis THEN the system SHALL work within the existing 4-phase agent workflow (Intelligence → Research → Risk → Trading)
9. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL use existing Winston logging and structured data formats
10. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current Docker Compose and environment configuration

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can validate system behavior and ensure reliability of trading algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for all risk management functions replacing placeholders
2. WHEN validating strategies THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for backtesting framework with known historical scenarios
3. WHEN testing data providers THEN the system SHALL simulate provider failures and validate fallback behavior
4. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL validate system behavior under high-frequency data loads
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include end-to-end tests covering the complete 12-agent analysis workflow
